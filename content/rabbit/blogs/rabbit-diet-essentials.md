# Rabbit Diet Essentials: Complete Nutrition Guide for House Rabbits

Proper nutrition is crucial for rabbit health, and their dietary needs are quite specific and different from other pets. Understanding what rabbits need nutritionally can prevent serious health issues and ensure a long, healthy life.

## The Rabbit Digestive System

### Unique Digestive Process
Rabbits are **hindgut fermenters** with a complex digestive system:
- **Cecum**: Large fermentation chamber for breaking down fiber
- **Cecotrophy**: Eating special soft feces to absorb nutrients
- **Dual digestive process**: Food passes through system twice
- **High fiber requirement**: Essential for gut health

### Why Fiber Matters
- **Dental health**: Chewing fiber keeps teeth worn down
- **Digestive health**: Prevents GI stasis and soft stool
- **Mental stimulation**: Natural foraging behavior
- **Weight management**: Filling but low in calories

## The Hay Foundation

### Timothy Hay (Primary Hay)
**Daily Amount**: Unlimited, fresh supply always available

#### Benefits
- **High fiber content**: Essential for digestive health
- **Dental wear**: Keeps continuously growing teeth healthy
- **Low calcium**: Appropriate for adults (not growing rabbits)
- **Mental enrichment**: Satisfies natural foraging instincts

#### Quality Indicators
- **Green color**: Fresh, not yellow or brown
- **Sweet smell**: Fresh grass scent, not musty
- **Minimal dust**: Dust can cause respiratory issues
- **Long stems**: Provides proper dental wear

### Other Hay Types

#### Orchard Grass
- **Good alternative**: For rabbits who don't like timothy
- **Similar nutrition**: Comparable fiber content
- **Softer texture**: Easier for some rabbits to eat

#### Alfalfa Hay
- **High calcium**: Only for growing rabbits under 6 months
- **Too rich for adults**: Can cause urinary issues
- **Occasional treat**: Small amounts for adult rabbits

## Pellet Guidelines

### Age-Appropriate Pellets

#### Adult Rabbits (over 6 months)
- **Daily amount**: 1/4 to 1/2 cup per 5 pounds body weight
- **Minimum fiber**: 18% crude fiber
- **Protein content**: 12-14%
- **No seeds, nuts, or colorful bits**: Simple, uniform pellets

#### Young Rabbits (under 6 months)
- **Higher protein**: 16-18% protein content
- **Unlimited pellets**: Until 6 months of age
- **Transition gradually**: To adult formula around 6 months

### Pellet Quality
Look for pellets that are:
- **Uniform in color and size**
- **High in fiber (minimum 18%)**
- **Timothy hay-based**
- **Free from artificial colors**
- **Free from seeds, nuts, and "treats"**

## Fresh Vegetables

### Daily Vegetable Requirements
**Amount**: 2-4 cups of leafy greens per 6 pounds body weight
**Variety**: 3-5 different types daily

### Excellent Daily Vegetables (Unlimited)
- **Romaine lettuce**: High in vitamins A and K
- **Green leaf lettuce**: Good source of folate
- **Red leaf lettuce**: Antioxidants and vitamins
- **Arugula**: Peppery taste, high in calcium
- **Endive**: Good source of fiber and vitamins
- **Escarole**: Mild flavor, well-accepted
- **Radicchio**: Adds color and nutrients

### Good Vegetables (2-3 times per week)
- **Cilantro**: Fresh herbs are excellent
- **Parsley**: High in vitamin C (limit due to calcium)
- **Dill**: Another herb rabbits often enjoy
- **Basil**: Fresh and aromatic
- **Mint**: Some rabbits love the flavor
- **Dandelion greens**: Excellent nutrition if pesticide-free

### Limited Vegetables (Treats, small amounts)
- **Carrots**: High in sugar, 1 baby carrot daily max
- **Bell peppers**: Remove seeds and stem
- **Cucumber**: High water content, limited nutrition
- **Zucchini**: Small amounts, well-tolerated
- **Broccoli leaves**: Better than florets
- **Cabbage**: Small amounts, can cause gas

### Vegetables to AVOID
- **Iceberg lettuce**: No nutritional value, can cause diarrhea
- **Onions and garlic**: Toxic to rabbits
- **Potatoes**: High starch, can cause digestive issues
- **Rhubarb**: Toxic leaves and high oxalates
- **Avocado**: All parts are toxic
- **Chocolate**: Toxic to rabbits
- **Seeds and pits**: From fruits, potential choking hazard

## Introducing New Foods

### Gradual Introduction Process
1. **One new food at a time**: Introduce over 3-5 days
2. **Start small**: 1-2 tablespoons initially
3. **Monitor closely**: Watch for soft stool or decreased appetite
4. **Increase gradually**: If well-tolerated, increase amount
5. **Remove if problems**: Any digestive upset means stop immediately

### Signs of Digestive Upset
- **Soft or runny stool**
- **Decreased appetite**
- **Lethargy or reduced activity**
- **Smaller or fewer fecal pellets**
- **Gas or bloating**

## Water Requirements

### Fresh Water Daily
- **Amount**: 1-3 ounces per pound body weight daily
- **Container**: Heavy ceramic bowls or water bottles
- **Quality**: Fresh, clean water changed daily
- **Temperature**: Room temperature preferred

### Water Bottle vs. Bowl
**Water Bowls** (Preferred):
- More natural drinking position
- Higher water intake
- Easier to clean thoroughly

**Water bottles**:
- Stays cleaner in dusty environments
- Prevents spillage
- Good for travel

## Treats and Forbidden Foods

### Healthy Treat Options (Very Limited)
**Fruits** (1-2 tablespoons per 6 pounds body weight daily):
- **Apple** (remove seeds): Sweet and crunchy
- **Banana** (small slice): High sugar, very limited
- **Berries**: Blueberries, strawberries (1-2 pieces)
- **Papaya**: Good for preventing blockages
- **Pineapple**: Fresh only, aids digestion

### Commercial Treats
Most commercial rabbit treats are:
- **Too high in sugar and starch**
- **Can cause digestive problems**
- **Unnecessary for rabbit nutrition**
- **Can lead to selective eating**

**Better alternatives**:
- Small pieces of fresh fruit
- Dried herbs (parsley, cilantro)
- Fresh herb plants to nibble

## Special Dietary Considerations

### Senior Rabbits (over 6 years)
- **Higher pellet amount**: May need 1/2 to 3/4 cup daily
- **Softer foods**: If dental issues develop
- **Regular weight monitoring**: Prevent weight loss
- **Increased vegetables**: If losing weight

### Overweight Rabbits
- **Reduce pellets**: Cut back gradually
- **Increase hay**: Unlimited timothy hay
- **More vegetables**: Fill up on low-calorie greens
- **Exercise opportunities**: Encourage movement

### GI Stasis Prevention
GI stasis is a life-threatening condition where the digestive system slows or stops.

#### Prevention Diet
- **High fiber intake**: Unlimited timothy hay
- **Consistent feeding schedule**: Same times daily
- **Avoid sugary/starchy foods**: Including many commercial treats
- **Fresh water always available**
- **Gradual diet changes**: Never sudden switches

#### Warning Signs
- **Reduced or no fecal pellets**
- **Smaller than normal pellets**
- **Loss of appetite**
- **Lethargy**
- **Hunched posture**

*GI stasis requires immediate veterinary attention.*

## Feeding Schedule and Routine

### Daily Feeding Routine
**Morning**:
- Fresh hay replenishment
- Daily pellet portion
- Fresh water

**Evening**:

## Common Feeding Mistakes

### What NOT to Do
- **Don't feed unlimited pellets** to adult rabbits
- **Don't give iceberg lettuce** - no nutritional value
- **Don't feed muesli-style foods** - leads to selective eating
- **Don't give human snacks** - crackers, cookies, bread
- **Don't feed lawn clippings** - may contain pesticides
- **Don't make sudden diet changes** - can cause GI upset

## Budget-Friendly Feeding Tips

### Money-Saving Strategies
- **Buy hay in bulk**: Often cheaper per pound
- **Grow your own herbs**: Parsley, cilantro, basil
- **Shop seasonal vegetables**: Rotate based on prices
- **Join rabbit groups**: Bulk buying cooperatives
- **Avoid commercial treats**: Make your own with safe fruits

## When to Consult a Veterinarian

### Dietary Concerns
- **Sudden appetite loss**
- **Changes in fecal output**
- **Weight loss or gain**
- **Difficulty eating**
- **Signs of GI stasis**

### Regular Check-ups
- **Annual exams**: Discuss diet and body condition
- **Weight monitoring**: Prevent obesity
- **Dental checks**: Ensure proper tooth wear
- **Senior care**: Adjust diet for aging needs

## The Bottom Line

A proper rabbit diet is simple but specific: unlimited timothy hay, limited pellets, daily fresh vegetables, and fresh water. Avoid the temptation to give treats and human foodsâ€”rabbits thrive on consistency and high-fiber nutrition.

**Remember**:
- Hay is the foundation of rabbit nutrition
- Vegetables provide variety and nutrition
- Pellets are a supplement, not the main course
- Fresh water should always be available
- Changes should be made gradually

A well-fed rabbit is a healthy rabbit, and proper nutrition is one of the best investments you can make in your rabbit's long-term health and happiness.
