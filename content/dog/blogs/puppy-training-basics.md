# Essential Puppy Training: The First 12 Weeks

Bringing home a new puppy is one of life's greatest joys, but it also comes with the responsibility of proper training. The first 12 weeks are crucial for establishing good habits and preventing behavioral problems later in life.

## Week 1-2: Settling In

### Establishing Routine
- **Feeding Schedule**: Feed at the same times daily (3-4 times for puppies under 6 months)
- **Sleep Schedule**: Puppies need 18-20 hours of sleep per day
- **Potty Breaks**: Take outside every 1-2 hours, especially after meals and naps

### House Training Basics
1. **Choose a designated potty spot** outside
2. **Use a consistent command** like "go potty"
3. **Reward immediately** when they go in the right place
4. **Never punish accidents** - simply clean and move on

## Week 3-4: Basic Commands

### Essential Commands to Start
- **Sit**: Hold treat above head, move back - most puppies naturally sit
- **Come**: Use happy, excited voice and reward generously
- **Stay**: Start with just 1-2 seconds, gradually increase
- **Down**: Lure with treat from sit position to floor

### Training Tips
- Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes)
- Use high-value treats (small pieces of chicken, cheese)
- End on a positive note
- Practice multiple times throughout the day

## Week 5-8: Socialization Window

This is the **critical socialization period**. Expose your puppy to:

### People
- Different ages (children, adults, elderly)
- Various appearances (hats, uniforms, wheelchairs)
- Different voices and energy levels

### Environments
- Various surfaces (grass, concrete, gravel, stairs)
- Different sounds (vacuum, doorbell, traffic)
- Car rides and different locations

### Other Animals
- Well-socialized adult dogs
- Cats (if applicable to your household)
- Always ensure positive experiences

## Week 9-12: Advanced Training

### Loose Leash Walking
1. Start indoors with collar and leash
2. Use treats to encourage walking beside you
3. Stop moving when puppy pulls
4. Only move forward when leash is loose

### Addressing Common Issues
- **Biting/Nipping**: Redirect to appropriate toys
- **Jumping**: Turn away and ignore until calm
- **Barking**: Don't yell (they think you're joining in)

## Crate Training Success

### Making the Crate Positive
- Feed meals inside the crate
- Place comfortable bedding and toys
- Never use as punishment
- Start with short periods, gradually increase

### Schedule for Crate Training
- **Week 1**: 30 minutes maximum
- **Week 2-4**: Up to 2 hours
- **Week 5-8**: 3-4 hours maximum
- **Adult dogs**: Up to 8 hours (not recommended for puppies)

## Common Training Mistakes

### What NOT to Do
- **Don't use punishment-based methods** - they can create fear and aggression
- **Don't skip socialization** - undersocialized dogs often have behavioral issues
- **Don't expect perfection** - puppies are babies and need time to learn
- **Don't train when frustrated** - dogs pick up on your emotions

## When to Seek Professional Help

Contact a professional trainer if:
- Aggressive behavior toward people or other animals
- Extreme fear or anxiety that doesn't improve
- House training isn't progressing after 6 weeks
- You feel overwhelmed or frustrated

## Training Schedule Example

### Daily Routine
- **6 AM**: Potty break, breakfast, short training session
- **9 AM**: Potty break, playtime, nap
- **12 PM**: Lunch, potty break, socialization activity
- **3 PM**: Potty break, training session, nap
- **6 PM**: Dinner, potty break, family time
- **9 PM**: Final potty break, settle for night

## Essential Supplies

### Training Tools
- High-quality treats (small, soft pieces)
- 6-foot leash (not retractable for training)
- Properly fitted collar or harness
- Crate appropriate for adult size
- Variety of safe toys

## The Bottom Line

Remember, every puppy learns at their own pace. Stay consistent, patient, and positive. The effort you put in during these first 12 weeks will pay dividends for your dog's entire life. When in doubt, consult with your veterinarian or a certified dog trainer.

**Key Takeaway**: Consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement are the foundations of successful puppy training. Start early, stay committed, and enjoy the journey with your new best friend.
